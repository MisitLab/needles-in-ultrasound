## Welcome to the MISIT-lab Needles in Ultrasound GitHub page.
On this page you can find codes, processed data and relevant files that belong to the research study:

**Title**: A methodical quantification of needle visibility and echogenicity in ultrasound images.

**Authors**: Nick J. van de Berg, Juan A. Sánchez-Margallo, Arjan P van Dijke; Thomas Langø and John J van den Dobbelsteen.

**Journal**: Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology

**DOI**: t.b.d.

## Subdirectories:
**Data summary**: quick overview of data (Matlab)
- 'ech_collected_data.mat' contains needle echogenicity data,
- 'vis_collected_data.mat' contains needle visibility data,
- Run 'ech_data_show.m' or 'vis_data_show.m' to visualise the data.

**Image processing**: ultrasound video file analysis (Matlab)
- Run 'ech_improc.m' or 'vis_improc.m' to skip through the analysed ultrasound image frames,
- Examplar videos are added for code verification.

**Rotational platform control unit**: electronical parts and Arduino codes,
- 'Needles_in_Ultrasound_v1_2.ino' contains the Arduino code for the control unit,

**Rotational platform design**: mechanical parts.
- CAD models and purchased parts.


Note I: GitHub is not meant for data storage. Raw data (here: ultrasound videos, approx 7GB) are available upon request.

Note II: Bit rates of examplar video files were sometimes reduced to stay below the 25 MB limit. We do not guarantee equal video quality as the original files. Video quality did not reduce visibly.
